    			<h3>Hit Locations</h3>
    			<p>Players have five locations which may be Wounded: Left Arm, Right Arm, Left Leg, Right Leg, and Torso<br>
    			<b>Arm:</b> From just below the outside point of the shoulder to the tips of the fingers. A hand is not Wounded if struck below the wrist while holding a weapon or shield. Treat those strikes as though they had struck the weapon or shield held instead.<br>
				<b>Leg:</b> From just below the end of the buttocks in the back, the hip socket in the front, and an imaginary line between them on the sides down to and including the foot. A foot on the ground is not Wounded if struck below the ankle.<br>
				<b>Torso:</b> Everything that isn’t an arm or leg, including the groin, shoulders, and collar bones up to the vertical rise of the neck</p>
				<p><h3>Notes:</h3>
				<ol>
				<li>Players may not be struck in the neck or head. Will not count as a hit and is invalid</li>
				<li>Players may not block shots with their neck or head. Intentional head blocking can result in being called dead by a reeve</li>
				<li>A Wounded arm may not wield Active Equipment, carry anything, and must be kept out of combat</li>
				<li>A Wounded leg must have the knee in contact with the ground. The knee of the Wounded leg may be lifted from the ground briefly to enable movement so long as the unwounded leg has a knee on the ground. If the player cannot place their dead knee in contact with the ground, the foot of the Wounded leg must remain stationary, and may only be used to pivot. The player must immediately notify his/ her opponent(s) of this by stating <i>“posting”</i> in order avoid dropping to his/her knees</li>
				<li>A Wounded leg may not receive Wounds while the knee is on the ground or during the initial placement of the knee on the ground after receiving a Wound. If “posting”, the previously Wounded leg is capable of receiving an additional Wound</li>

    			<h3>Combat Contact</h3>
    			<p>A broad range of contact is allowed in combat. The rules below outline what is and is not acceptable. No action is acceptable if it is performed in an unsafe manner. The responsibility for the results of an action always rests squarely on the the actor. Unsafe behavior on the field can result in suspension from play at the discretion of the Champion, Monarch, or Guildmaster of Reeves.
    			</p>
    			<p><b>Allowed:</b> The following actions are acceptable<br>
    			<ol>
				<li>Weapon to Weapon contact is allowed</li>
				<li>Weapon to body contact is allowed on valid Hit Locations using Strike-Legal portions</li>
				<li>Body to Weapon contact: Weapons may be pushed, swept, and otherwise manipulated with your body so long as the Weapon is not trapped or grabbed. Pushing or sweeping a Strike-Legal surface results in a valid hit to the location used for contact.</li>
				<li>Weapon to Shield contact is allowed</li>
				<li>Shield to Weapon contact: Shields may be used to deflect, move or pin an opponents Weapon</li>
				<li>Shield to Shield contact: Shields may be used to deflect, turn, or pin an opponents Shield so long as the wielder of the struck Shield is not moved. Bashing a shield is prohibited</li>
				</ol></p>
    			<p><b>Disallowed:</b> The following actions are unacceptable. Some amount of incidental contact is expected in a contact sport but repeated or egregious offenses will result in suspension<br>
    			<ol>
    			<li>Body to body contact is prohibited</li>
				<li>Body to Shield contact is prohibited</li>
				<li>Active Shield to body contact is prohibited; passively using a Shield to prevent an opponent’s forward movement is acceptable and does not count as body to Shield contact on the part of the recipient</li>
				<li>Active Weapon to body contact using portions of a Weapon other than Strike-Legal is prohibited; passively planting the shaft of a Great Weapon to block an incoming opponent is acceptable</li>
				<li>Forcing a player’s Weapons against them with your body or Shield is prohibited</li>

    			<h3>Inflicting Wounds</h3>
    			<p>Wounds may be inflicted by contacting a Hit Location with the Strike-Legal portion of a Weapon. Shots from Melee Weapons fall into two broad categories:<br>
    			<b>Slash:</b> A valid slash must be percussive (contact with an audible pop) and stop on or deflect off the victim.<br>
				<b>Stab:</b> A valid stab should strike with the tip and stop on or deflect off the victim.</p>
				<p>These requirements do not apply to projectile weapons. Any contact from the Strike-Legal portion of a projectile weapon will cause a Wound unless otherwise noted.</p>
				<p>Some contacts which partially fulfill the above criteria are listed here as examples of invalid shots</p>
				<p>
				<b>Examples of Invalid Shots:</b><br>
				<b>Grazes:</b> Slashes that are neither percussive nor stop/deflect<br>
				<b>Draw Cuts:</b> Stabs which fail to strike with thetip. These contacts slide against a victim instead of impacting cleanly<br>
				<b>Pushes:</b> These contacts are pushed into or slid against a victim after the initial motion was completely blocked and the initial motion had stopped<br></p>

    			<h3>Combat Notes</h3>
    			<p>Miscellaneous rules necessary for the smooth operation of combat</p>
    			<p>
    			<ol>
	    			<li>Shots that only strike garb or unwielded equipment do not count as a hit unless:</li>
	    			<ol>
	    				<li>Said items blocked a blow that would have struck a combatant (i.e. garb, equipment, sheathed
	weapons, etc. are not shields and do not count as armor)</li>
						<li>The shot is Engulfing. Engulfing effects do trigger on garb and equipment hits</li>
					</ol>
	    			<li>If a person is wounded in an arm throwing a shot, or killed, shots they threw into motion before being struck still count as a hit, if they land within a half second of being struck. In the case of a two-handed weapon, the wielder must remove his wounded hand from the weapon within a half second for the shot to count. This should be a clear case of finishing an already thrown shot, meaning that it requires no change of direction and the last action required to finish the shot has already been started prior to being struck. If you have any questions, ask your kingdom/group level Guildmaster of Reeves. A reeve‘s call is always final in determining if a shot is in time or late</li>
					<li>Unless otherwise noted in the battlegame description players may always choose to take a Death. Players who take a Death may not return to play except by respawning, may not activate any ‘on death’ Magic and Abilities such as Fight After Death, have all Enchantments removed (including Persistent ones), and do not benefit from any Magic or Abilities that prevent Death such as Undead Minion.</li>
