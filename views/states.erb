                <h3>States Defined</h3>
                <p>All abilities and magics (with a few exceptions) make use of a small set of common terms to explain the result they have on the player. These results are referred to as a ‘State’ or ‘States’. A player can have any number of different States simultaneously. A State may have a duration, after which it expires. If a player would gain a State they are already affected by, the State’s duration will simply be adjusted to the new duration if it is longer than the current duration. A State without a duration continues until it is removed by some outside force or until a condition is met. Unless otherwise noted, States cannot apply to dead players and are removed when a player dies or has an effect activate which allows the player struck to avoid death (Undead Minion, Greater Undead Minion, Troll Blood, Phoenix Tears, Song of Survival). A State conferred by a class Trait, such as Immunity to Subdual, is always on and may not be removed by respawn, death, or any other means. States imparted at the same time as a killing blow are considered to have taken effect prior to death. If a State which prevented a player from moving expires due to its duration ending, the player it affected must declare, “No longer [State that ended]”. This must be audible out to 20 feet<p>

                <h3>States Made Easy</h3>
                <p>The number and variety of Magic, Abilities, States, and Special Effects can seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. Here are a few quick steps to help you learn what you need to know to play on the field with magic and abilities.</p>
                <p>Only three things can adversely affect you: Weapons, Magic Balls, and Verbals.</p>
                <p>Weapons and Magic Balls have to physically hit you or your equipment to have an effect. No hit, no effect, no problem.</p>
                <p>Engulfing Magic Balls (Iceball, etc) and weapons (Pinning Arrow, etc) can affect you by hitting your equipment or garb. Everything else has to hit your body. Engulfing isn’t terribly common.</p>
                <p>Verbal Magic and Abilities all follow the same format: They state your name, point at you, and say an incantation of three repetitions of a phrase that activates the Verbal.</p>
                <p>All offensive Verbals have very descriptive incantations. The incantation typically contains the School and the State of the Magic or Ability being used. Example: The incantation for Hold Person is “I command thee to stop” three times; The School is ‘Command’ and the State it inflicts is ‘Stopped’.</p>
                <p>No Verbal has a range greater than 50’. If you can get further away from the caster than that you won’t be affected.</p>
                <p>There are lots of Magic and Abilities, but only a few results. If you read through and understand the States Defined and Special Effects Defined sections you will understand the result of any Magic or Ability used against you in combat on the field. All offensive combat abilities (with very few exceptions) result in one of those States or Special Effects. If you don’t know what a magic or ability does by its incantation don’t worry; ask the caster to explain and they can communicate to you in just a couple of words exactly what happened using States and Special Effects.</p>
                <p>Immunities are also very simple: If the Magic or Ability targeting you is of a given School (which is always part of the incantation) and you have Immunity to that School, then the magic or ability has no effect on you. The only exception is if they are targeting equipment you are carrying instead of you yourself, but the player will have to indicate that as part of using the Magic or Ability. If you are unaffected by a Magic or Ability, you must announce it when the Magic or Ability is complete. You can also let them know before hand if you’re feeling generous</p>

                <h3>Immune</h3>
                <p>The bearing player or object is not affected by Magic or Abilities from a given School.<br>
                Unless otherwise noted:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Immunities always take effect after Traits but before Resistances and any other effects</li>
                    <li>Immunity granted as a Trait does not prevent players from making use of their own class Abilities</li>
                    <li>Unless otherwise noted, Immunities do not extend beyond the player or object that has them. Example: A player with Immunity to Flame can still have their armor destroyed by a Fireball</li>
                    <li>If a player is Immune to an effect which would remove a State or ongoing effect, the State/ongoing effect is not removed. Example: A player who is Immune to Sorcery cannot be Released from Frozen, as they cannot be affected by Release, a Sorcery school ability</li>
                    <li>Players with Immunities may still be targeted by Magic and Abilities of the given School. Example: A player with Immunity to Flame can still be the target of Pyrotechnics which would still destroy their equipment (as Immunities do not extend to equipment unless noted)</li>
                    <li>Immunities do not interact with Enchantments worn by the player. Example One: An Anti-paladin may wear the Flame Blade Enchantment. Example Two: A player with Protection From Magic still gains Stopped if Heart of the Swarm is later cast on them. Example Three: A player may still benefit from the Heal from Regeneration, even if they are Cursed. Example Four: A player with Greater Undead Minion and Enlightened Soul would still have their enchantment removed when Banish is cast on them while insubstantial</li>
                    <li>A target becoming Immune to the source of an ongoing effect or State while it is applied does not remove ongoing effects or States currently affecting the target. Example: If a player who is Stopped by Hold Person casts Song of Determination on themselves, that player remains Stopped</li>

                        <li>The ending Incantation for Insubstantial is not interrupted by the player moving their feet, and does not require a free hand</li>
                        <li>Insubstantial triggered from enchantments worn is not considered voluntary</li>
                        <li>Must indicate their Insubstantial State by saying “Insubstantial” if asked, attacked, or targeted by a Magic or Ability</li>
                        <li>May not delay the game excessively. For instance, you may not use the Insubstantial State to avoid being killed if you are the last player alive in a Mutual Annihiliation battlegame. The reeves decision in these situations is final</li>

                <h3>Special Effects</h3>
                <p>Special Effects are a common language used to define battlefield events. Special Effects typically trigger when a player or object is hit by a weapon, Magic Ball, or targeted by a completed Verbal. A single event typically only has one relevant Special Effect. For instance a Destruction Arrow is both Armor Destroying and Shield Destroying, but there is no situation in which both of those matter simultaneously. Likewise a sword may be both Armor Breaking and Wounds Kill, but players are not affected by Armor Breaking and armor is not affected by Wounds Kill. When using a melee weapon which causes a Special Effect you must announce it to your opponent at the beginning of an engagement and periodically during the engagement when reasonable. Example: a Barbarian moving to engage an unarmored Scout need not announce ‘Armor Breaking’; however if an armored Paladin moves into the engagement the Barbarian should announce ‘Armor Breaking’ at their soonest reasonable opportunity. The game flows more smoothly and everybody has more fun when Special Effects are stated ahead of time rather than kept as surprises</p>
                <p><b>Armor Breaking:</b> A hit to armor from a weapon, Magic Ball, etc. with the Armor Breaking ability will immediately remove all Armor Points from the location struck if the location struck currently has three or less Armor Points. If the armor currently has four or more Armor Points then the armor has one Armor Point removed as per normal. Example: Armor with 4 points is struck by a weapon with Armor Breaking. The armor loses an Armor Point at the location struck. The armor is struck again in the same location which now has 3 points. The Armor Points at that location are reduced to zero and the wearer is unharmed unless otherwise noted. Denoted by announcing “Breaking”</p>
                <p><b>Armor Destroying:</b> A hit to armor from a weapon, Magic Ball, etc. with the Armor Destroying Special Effect reduces the armor to zero points in the location struck. The wearer is unharmed unless otherwise noted. Denoted by announcing “Destroying”</p>
                <p><b>Shield Crushing:</b> A shield that has received any Shield Crushing hits is damaged. A shield that has been damaged any amount may be repaired. A shield that receives 3 Shield Crushing hits is also destroyed. The wearer is unharmed. Hits do not all have to be from the same source; hits from different sources are cumulative. Denoted by announcing “Shield Crushing”.</p>
                <p><b>Shield Destroying:</b> A hit to a shield from a weapon, Magic Ball, etc. with the Shield Destroying Special Effect destroys the shield. The wearer is unharmed unless otherwise noted. Denoted by announcing “Shield Destroying”</p>
                <p><b>Weapon Destroying:</b> A weapon hit by an effect with the Weapon Destroying Special Effect is destroyed</p>
                <p><b>Wounds Kill:</b> Players Wounded by objects with the Wounds Kill Special Effect are killed. Denoted by announcing “Wounds Kill”.
