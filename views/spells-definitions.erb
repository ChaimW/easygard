                <p>Some abilities may have their per-life or per-refresh uses restored after they are consumed. These abilities are denoted with the word “Charge” and a number after them. In order to gain an additional per-life or per-refresh use of a Chargeable ability the Charge Incantation must be repeated in full the number of times indicated by number after Charge.

                <p>The Incantation (see Incantation for general rules about Incantations) that is used to Charge an ability. A single ‘Charge Incantation’ is repeating the following phrase:</p>
                <p><i>“Out of battle I pause to rest,<br>
                I take some time to catch my breath.<br>
                Return to me my fleeting power<br>
                To aid me in my darkest hour.”</i></p>

                <h3>Incantation</h3>
                <p>The verbal component required by some magics and abilities that initiates their function.<br>
                Magic and Abilities used at a Range greater than Touch require that the target be indicated by name. Example: <i>“Timmy, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop.”</i> If the name of the target is not known, or if the casting player prefers, they may instead point at the target with a free hand and say two descriptors for the target, such as their class and the color of their tunic. Example: &lt;Point with a free hand &gt; <i>“Warrior in blue, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop, I command thee to stop.”</i> When targeting a piece of equipment the caster must explicitly define the equipment in addition to the player most recently using it. Example: <i>“Timmy, blue sword on hip, I call upon flame to heat that sword, I call upon flame to heat that sword, I call upon  flame to heat that sword.”</i></p>
                <p>All Incantations:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Must be said loudly and clearly enough to be heard within 50’ or by the recipient, whichever is closer. Incantations which target self must be audible to within 20’. In the event of a disagreement over audible range, consult a reeve</li>
                    <li>A player may not move their feet when incanting. If a player moves their feet the incant is interrupted</li>
                    <li>Improper wording, mispronunciation, a gap of more than two seconds between words, or omitting words will all result in an interrupted Incantation</li>
                    <li>An interrupted incantation does not result in a magic or ability being consumed. Interrupted Incantations must be restarted from the beginning</li>
                    <li>Require the caster to have an empty hand with the exception of holding Material Components or the target of a Touch Range or Other Rangemagic. Any hand that is touching a shield or weapon is not considered an empty hand, with the exception of hands incidentally touching Small shields that are strapped securely to the arm.</li>
                    <li>Starting an Incantation renders the player’s active Magic Balls inactive and interrupts any other Incantation or Chant the player has in progress</li>
                    <li>The target of a Magic or Ability must be at least partially visible at the completion of an Incantation. The target being out of sight at any other point does not prevent or interrupt the casting attempt. If a piece of equipment is the target, the physical equipment itself is what needs to be at least partially visible. If the incantation is completed and the target is not at least partially visible, the Magic or Ability has no effect but is still expended</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Completing an Incantation results in an Ability or Magic being used up, regardless of if the target was valid or affected</p>

                <p>Magic Armor is provided by some Enchantments. The specific enchantment will denote a number of points of Magic Armor that are granted to each hit location.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Enchantments which grant Magic armor fail when targeting a player with worn armor. Players may not don worn armor while bearing an enchantment which grants magic armor. If Magic Armor is granted from two different sources only the highest value present is used and all others are ignored. Example: A player is wearing both <a href="/spells/g#giftofearth" data-ajax="false">Gift of Earth</a> (2 points of Magic Armor) and <a href="/spells/b#barkskin" data-ajax="false">Barkskin</a> (1 point of Magic Armor). Since Gift of Earth is the highest value the Magic Armor from Barkskin is ignored. If Gift of Earth is removed the player will have a new Magic Armor maximum of 1 point. All locations greater than 1 point will be lowered to 1 point while all locations at 1 point or lower will remain unchanged</li>
                    <li>Magic Armor may be the target of magic or effects that affect armor such as Armor Breaking, Fireball, etc</li>
                    <li>Magic Armor may be repaired like any other armor</li>
                    <li>Magic Armor covers all locations on a player without any gaps in coverage</li>
                    <li>Unless otherwise noted in the description of the Enchantment, Magic Armor can never benefit from armor enhancement abilities or magics such as Ancestral Armor or Imbue Armor. Example: Stoneskin is naturally considered Ancestral Armor, but Barkskin can not benefit from Ancestral Armor in any way</li>
                    <li>Players may wear more Magic Armor than their class maximum allows. A class which cannot wear any armor can still wear Magic Armor</li>
                    <li>Unless otherwise noted Magic Armor behaves identically to <a href="/armor/" data-ajax="false">normal armor</a></li>
                    <li>The presence of Magic Armor must be announced to any opponents at the beginning of an engagement if possible; Magic Armor should not result in a <i>surprise survival</i></li>

                <h3>School</h3>
                <p>Magic and Abilities are divided into Schools, referred to commonly as the ‘Schools of Magic’. Each School specializes in a certain genre of magic and typically the effects of the different Magic and Abilities within a School are similar</p>
                <p><b>Command:</b> Typically makes players stop moving or change their actions in some manner. Frequently makes use of the Stopped, Frozen, and Insubstantial States. All offensive magic and abilities from the Command School are Verbals. All offensive magic and abilities from the Command School have the word <i>“command”</i> in the incantation</p>
                <p><b>Death:</b> Typically causes injury or death. Frequently makes use of the Cursed and Fragile States. All offensive magic and abilities from the Death School are Verbals. Offensive magic and abilities from the Death School tend to be very explicit about the result as part of the incantation such as <i>“I call for your death”</i></p>
                <p><b>Flame:</b>Typically destroys equipment or wounds/kills players. Offensive magic and abilities from the Flame School can be either a Verbal or a Magic Ball. Magic Balls from the Flame School typically destroy equipment and wound or kill players, while Verbals from the Flame School typically target equipment and destroy it, rather than targeting players themselves. All offensive Verbals from the Flame School have the word <i>“flame”</i> in the incantation</p>
                <p><b>Neutral:</b> Has effects that alter game play for the user in some manner and does not directly affect other players</p>
                <p><b>Protection:</b> Typically enchantments that provide magical armor, Immunity to a School, or Resistance to a School or State. There are no offensive magic or abilities in the Protection School</p>
                <p><b>Sorcery:</b> Typically effects that deal with raw magical force, manipulating magic itself, or controlling the aether. Offensive magic amd abilities from the Sorcery School tend to be very explicit about the result as part of the incantation and frequently includes the word <i>“power”</i>. Offensive magic and abilities from the Sorcery School are generally Verbals</p>
                <p><b>Spirit:</b> Typically Verbals that offer healing, resurrection, or the removal of harmful States with a few Enchantments sprinkled in.</p>
                <p><b>Subdual:</b> Typically makes a player stop moving or limits their actions. Makes use of the Stopped, Frozen, Stunned, and Suppressed States. All offensive magic and abilities in the Subdual School are Magic Balls</p>

                <p>Class Abilities that function all of the time without activation being required. Includes such things as Immunity and the ability to use extra equipment. Traits are denoted with a (T) and are always non-magical in nature. Traits may not be removed by any means and persist after respawn. Immunities granted by Traits persist after death. Traits are not enchantments, and do not count towards enchantment limits or count for the purposes of Attuned, Essence Graft, or similar magic and abilities. Note: Some Traits mimic other Magic or Abilities, but these Traits are still always on and ignore any Incantation or Materials requirement listed. Traits always take effect before Immunities, Resistances, and any other effects</p>

Ongoing Effects may have a duration, after which it expires. If a player would gain an Ongoing Effect they are already affected by, the Ongoing Effect’s duration will simply be adjusted to the new duration if it is longer than the current duration. An Ongoing Effect without a duration continues until it is removed by some outside force or until a condition is met. Unless otherwise noted, Ongoing Effects cannot apply to dead players and are removed when a player dies or has an effect activate which allows the player struck to avoid death (Undead Minion, Greater Undead Minion, Troll Blood, Phoenix Tears, Song of Survival)</p>
